# Flutter Season 2 Coursework

This repository now hosts both the legacy Dart command-line exercises and the new Flutter game projects for the class. Use the directory layout below to jump to the materials you need.

## Repository Layout
- `dart/exercises/` – original Dart exercises and samples that accompanied the earlier lessons.
- `flutter/word_guess_game/` – the first Flutter game project; future games can live alongside this directory.

## Working with the Dart Exercises
1. `cd dart/exercises`
2. Run `dart pub get`
3. Use `dart run` or `dart test` as needed.

## Working with the Flutter Projects
1. `cd flutter/word_guess_game`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Launch with `flutter run` (choose your target device or emulator).

> Tip: feel free to add more projects under either `dart/` or `flutter/` as the course expands.
